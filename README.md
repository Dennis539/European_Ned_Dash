# European_Ned_Dash

See the dashboard on https://dash-eredivisie-europe.herokuapp.com/ (loading might take a while). 
This dashboard shows how the top 5 clubs of the Netherlands in a European context have fared in European matches. 
(Ajax, PSV, Feyenoord, AZ and Twente). 
To obtain the information, numerous API's have been built which pulled data from various resources. This data was
then transformed and visualised by using the Dash library which is a Python library for creating dashboards/web applications. 
The app itself consists of four different pages:
- The first page contains a map which shows all the locations of all of the oppoents which these clubs have played against. 
- The second page shows visualizations which are related to opponent clubs. 
- The third page shows visualizations which are related to opponent players, meaning that this is all on an individual basis. 
- The fourth page shows visualizations and statistics related to the Eredivisie players and clubs themselves. 


To do:
- Fix the filter of nationality on the fourth tap. 
- Critical look at the layout. 
- Create something which can be run every month.
